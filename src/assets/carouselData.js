      `<span class='blue'>freeCodeCamp Alumni Network:</span> A mentorship driven
      Social network built for the freeCodeCamp community. By far the biggest project
      I've created from scratch &mdash; I coded about 80-90% of this application as
      an exercise in learning full-stack JavaScript development. Current Membership:

      `<span class='blue'>Interactive ReactJS Challenges:</span> This project was
      developed for <a href="http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/challenges/react/
      introduction-to-the-react-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      beta.freeCodeCamp.com.</a> freeCodeCamp has been working on a major curriculum
      expansion for several months, and these challenges will eventually be an integral
      part of the Frontend Libraries Certificate section. I contributed several challenges
      to this project, including designing and writing the challenges, developing the
      code, and writing the unit tests.
      <br /><br />
      The testing framework, primarily developed by <a href="http://sean-smith.me/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sean Smith</a>, tests React code in
      the browser using AirBnB's Enzyme library, and includes live rendering/output
      when code is changed.
      <br /><br />
      <span>Technologies:</span> ReactJS, Enzyme, React-CodeMirror, & more.

      `<span class='blue'>CS-Playground-React:</span> A simple, in-browser JavaScript sandbox
      for learning and practicing some core Computer Science fundamentals: sorting algorithms
      and data structures. Learn algorithms like Mergesort, Quicksort, and Heapsort, and data structures
      like stacks, queues, and binary search trees. The app saves your progress as you code, comes
      with solutions for when you get stuck, and plenty of resources to help you along the way!

      `<span class='blue'>Frontend Test Suites:</span> This project was also developed
      for the freeCodeCamp curriculum expansion. As more and more students join and
      utilize freeCodeCamp’s learning platform, we realized we needed a standardized
      way to measure completion of required projects. A test suite was created for
      each &mdash; as students code, they pass/fail tests and receive feedback and
      helpful errors along the way!
      <br /><br />
      The testing framework was developed by myself and another freeCodeCamp contributor,
      while I developed most of the individual test suites. We bundled the code using
      Webpack, and serve it over a CDN created from our repo. Student’s can then include
      the test framework in their projects (in a CodePen or locally) via a script tag.
      <br /><br />
      <span>Technologies:</span> JavaScript, Mocha, Chai, jQuery, Selenium, Webpack

      `<span class="blue">FCC Basic Data Structure (Array) Challenges:</span> As a
      freeCodeCamp Core Team member, I have made many contributions, mostly in the
      form of adding new projects to the freeCodeCamp ecosystem, like the <a href=
      "https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/testable-projects-fcc" target="_blank" rel=
      "noopener noreferrer">Frontend Test Suite</a> and the <a href=
      "https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module/" target="_blank" rel=
      "noopener noreferrer">new React Curriculum</a>. However, in addition to several
      challenge fixes, UI tweaks, and updates that are now in production, I also
      contributed a series of challenges to the yet-to-be-released beta curriculum
      for the Basic Data Structures section. While another contributor covered Objects,
      I designed, coded and implemented a series of 11 challenges, meant to familiarize
      students with the basic concepts surrounding JavaScript Arrays and their common methods.
